# Marta Issue Tracker

Marta is a file manager for macOS. It is very fast, highly configurable, and supports themes and plugins.  
You can read more about Marta on its official site: <https://marta.yanex.org/>. Come get some!

## Tracker status

This tracker was created to allow Marta users report bugs and submit feature requests.

Note that currently it is not the only home for issues, the other is the TODO list: https://quip.com/TOH6Abh8ruxi. I will probably continue using TODO for some time until I realize Github issues will be enough for me.

Anyway, if you could help me to migrate issues from the TODO to Github, I will be very happy. :blush:

## Feedback

Marta is still in alpha, so the feedback is highly appreciated! Please feel free to [create new issues](https://github.com/marta-file-manager/marta-issues/issues/new) or [vote](https://github.com/marta-file-manager/marta-issues/issues) for the existing ones. The number of :thumbsup: is a sign for me.
